      Hey there, I'm Cedric!
    </p>

    <p class="about">
      I'm currently a sophomore at Cornell and I'm studying how people interact with technology through a major in Information Science and concentration in User Experience. Originally, I intended on studying the technical side of computing, but found a passion for human-computer interaction through a student-taught course in Digital Product Design. I'm also interested in design outside of the digital realm and hope to explore physical design through a minor in Architecture!
    </p>

    <p class="about">
      Currently, I’m a designer on an engineering project team (Cornell Design and Tech Initiative) where I'm working on an app to centralize events at Cornell. I'm also interning as a product designer with an educational technology startup (EDUSIM) and working on making meaningful learning experiences.
    </p>
    <p class="aboutLast">
      I’m looking forward to a productive summer and am seeking opportunities that will better the community and challenge me as a designer!
