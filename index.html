        <p class="project_description">
          As a Product Intern for Concord (a SaaS startup focused on contract management processes), I was part of a growth project focused on leveraging trust, engagement, and adoption to improve the guest user experience. As a result I exercised my iteration skills in a rapid development environment to double guest conversion rate.

          Designed a mobile application from start-to-finish around the problem space of event discoverability. Began by utilizing research methods including surveys, in-person interviews, and direct obsertvation. Iterated through designs by collaborating with Porduct Managers, developers, and other designers as well as guerilla tested with users. Finally, I translated the solution from paper sketches to high fidelity mockups. (Not affiliated with Cornell University)

        <p class="project_description">
          For Intro to Digital Product Design (INFO 1998), user research showed me that Venmo users were hesitant about the security of transactions and frustrated by the lack of feedback from transactions. Here, I exercised my design process and conceptualized a meaningful feature that allows users to add a cover photo to their profiles.
