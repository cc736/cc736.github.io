          As a Product Intern for Concord (a SaaS startup focused on contract management processes), I was part of a growth project focused on leveraging trust, engagement, and adoption to improve the guest user experience. As a result I exercised my iteration skills in a rapid development environment to double guest conversion rate.

          Designed a mobile application from start-to-finish around the problem space of event discoverability. Began by utilizing research methods including surveys, in-person interviews, and direct obsertvation. Iterated through designs by collaborating with Porduct Managers, developers, and other designers as well as guerilla tested with users. Finally, I translated the solution from paper sketches to high fidelity mockups. (Not affiliated with Cornell University)

        <p class="project_description">
          For Intro to Digital Product Design (INFO 1998), user research showed me that there is a disconnect between finding music and our friends on Spotify. My solution to this problem was an in-app sharing experience that doubles as a way to keep users within the product. Through this I faced two challenges: (1) finding a salient entry point and (2) folding this feature into Spotify's current flows.
