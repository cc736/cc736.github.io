          Working with PMâ€™s and developers on a problem space at Cornell surrounding the discoverability and organization of events. I have conducted user research, competitor analysis, and used these to iterate on different designs with pen and pencil. Currently, I am finalizing the UI layout in a medium-fidelity stage through Sketch.app mockups.

        <p class="project_description">
          For Intro to Digital Product Design (INFO 1998), user research showed me that Venmo users were hesitant about the security of transactions and frustrated by the lack of feedback from transactions. Here, I exercised my design process and conceptualized a meaningful feature that allows users to add a cover photo to their profiles.
